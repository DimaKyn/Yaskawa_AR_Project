## Abstract
This project creates an AR mobile app for factory training. 
The app uses Vuforia and Unity to allow users to recognize a Yaskawa GP8 robot and virtualy place it.
Users can then simulate bolt training, welding and drilling procedures, receiving in-app rewards for completion.
Sound effects and explanations guide users through the app, providing an interactive training experience.
